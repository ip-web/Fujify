Unlocker

Unlock the Fujifilm Film Simulations for any camera's RAW files through Adobe Lightroom. This app allows you to convert DNG files ( or any other RAW with conversion ) from other camera brands to be compatible with Fujifilm's film simulation modes.

## Features

- **Convert RAW to DNG**: Supports various RAW file formats and converts them to DNG to enable film simulations.
- **Uses Powerful Tools**: Built using ExifTool, LibRaw, and DNGRaw for reliable and efficient conversion.
- **Easy to Use**: Drag and drop files or folders, or use the context menu and toolbar options to add files.
- **Windows Only**: Currently available for Windows users.

## How to Use

1. **Add Files**: Drag and drop files or folders into the app window, or use the context menu or toolbar to add files and folders.
2. **Choose Destination Folder**: Select a folder where the processed files will be saved. If no folder is selected, the processed files will be saved in the same location as the originals.
   - Note: If the "Backup Original" option is not selected and not destination folder is set, the original DNG files will be overwritten.
3. **Start Processing**: Click the "Process" button to begin processing your files.
